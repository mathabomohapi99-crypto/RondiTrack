# RondiTrack API (Week 4, Day 1)

A .NET 10 Web API for tracking stokvels and their members, with in-memory data.

## Controllers vs Minimal APIs
I chose Controllers. The assignment asks for explicit attribute routing and a nested
stokvel -> members route. Controllers keep each resource's routes together in one class,
which stays readable as the API grows.

## Rules enforced in code
**User:** name required (max 100 chars); email required, valid format and normalised to
lowercase. Emails are unique (409 on duplicates). A user who belongs to a stokvel cannot be
deleted, because removing a member mid-rotation would break payouts.

**Stokvel:** name required; contribution must be > 0 with at most 2 decimal places;
frequency must be Weekly/Fortnightly/Monthly; capacity 2-50 (a rotation needs at least 2
people). A member can't join twice, a full stokvel can't take more members, and capacity
can't be lowered below the current member count.

These live in the entity constructors and methods, so an invalid User or Stokvel cannot
be created. Members is exposed read-only; the only way to change it is AddMember/RemoveMember.

## Money
ContributionAmount is `decimal`, not `double`. Binary floating point can't represent
values like 0.1 exactly, which is unacceptable for money.

## Status codes
200 OK, 201 Created (with Location), 204 No Content, 400 invalid input,
404 not found, 409 conflict, 422 request references a non-existent user.

## Run it
    dotnet run
Open http://localhost:5134/scalar/v1 (port may vary - check your terminal output).
Seeded IDs: users 10000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000000{1-6},
stokvels 20000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000000{1-2}.
